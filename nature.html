        History
        Vagamon remained largely unexplored for centuries. Though the British had plantations here, it was only in 1926, when Walter Duncan and Company started their tea plantations, that it became well-known. In the 1930s, more tea plantations were set up in the area.[3] After 1940, people from Travancore, and Madras (Tamil Nadu), migrated to Vagamon. Later, after the formation of Kerala State, people from various parts of Kerala migrated there.[citation needed]
        
        In 1955, the Trappist monastery Kurisumala Ashram was founded in Vagamon.[6]
